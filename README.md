# scoreboard
Baby Steps of the Project
1. Turn on LEDs
2. Turn on Relay with RPi
3. Count Down Timer with RPi
4. Set up a 8-bit shift register to control Relays
5. Set Scores, Innings, Balls, Strikes and Outs
6. Set Time Of Day

*Can you make a "captive portal" for the web interface? As soon as the client connects to
scoreboard wifi, it redirects to the captive portal page.

*To control multiple lights with only a few inputs, I think is called Multiplexing.

*8-bit Shift Register 74HC595N
A shift register is a chip you can use to control many outputs (8 here) at the same time while only using a few pins (3 here) of your Arduino.

Some dude who triggered water pumps via the gpio pins. 
He used realays also which is why his wiring diagrams might prove useful.
